# RFC: Headless React Graph Library

## Abstract
This document proposes the creation of a headless React library for maintaining and manipulating graphs. The library aims to provide a robust API for graph operations while being UI-agnostic, allowing developers to integrate it with various front-end frameworks. Additionally, the library will support graph navigation and the maintenance of multiple paths simultaneously.

## Introduction
Maintaining and manipulating graphs is a common requirement in many applications, from data visualization to network analysis. This library will focus on providing a flexible and powerful interface for graph navigation and operations, designed to be used with React but not dependent on any specific UI components.

## Proposed Interface
### Graph Creation
Create a graph without any nodes.
```ts
import { createGraph } from 'react-graph'

const graph = createGraph()
```

### Adding Nodes

```ts
addNode('node1', { label: 'Node 1' })
addNode('node2', { label: 'Node 2' })
```

### Adding Edges

```ts
addEdge('node1', 'node2')
```

### Adding Relative Nodes

```ts
node.addParent('node1', {label: 'Node 1'}) 
// This creates a new node and connects it via an edge to the old node with a parent-child relationship.
// Translates to: 
addNode('node1', {label: 'Node 1'})
addEdge('node1', 'node2', { relationship: 'parent-child' })

node.addChild('node2', {label: 'Node 2'})
// Translates to:
addNode('node2', {label: 'Node 2'})
addEdge('node1', 'node2', { relationship: 'parent-child' })

// Retrieve children of a node
const children = getChildren('node1'); // ['node2']

// Check relationship
const isParentChild = getEdge('node1', 'node2').relationship === 'parent-child'; // true
```

### Graph Navigation

```ts
graph.navigateToNode('node1')
```

### Multiple Paths

```ts
graph.addPath(['node1', 'node2', 'node3'])
graph.addPath(['node1', 'node4', 'node5'])
```

## Capabilities

- **Graph Creation**: Initialize and configure graphs.
- **Node and Edge Management**: Add, remove, and update nodes and edges.
- **Traversal and Search**: Implement common graph algorithms like DFS, BFS, and shortest path.
- **Graph Navigation**: Navigate through the graph and focus on specific nodes.
- **Multiple Paths**: Support maintaining multiple paths simultaneously.

## Design Considerations

- **Headless Architecture**: The library will not include any UI components, allowing it to be used with various front-end frameworks.
- **Immutable Data Structures**: To ensure performance and predictability, the library will use immutable data structures.

## Implementation Plan

1. Initial setup and scaffolding
2. Basic graph operations (creation, addition, deletion)
3. Implementation of traversal algorithms
4. Graph navigation and multiple paths support
5. Optimization and performance improvements
6. Documentation and examples
7. Feedback and Discussion

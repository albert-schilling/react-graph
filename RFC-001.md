# RFC: Headless React Graph Library

## Abstract

This document proposes the creation of a headless React library for maintaining and manipulating graphs. The library aims to provide a robust API for graph operations while being UI-agnostic, allowing developers to integrate it with various front-end frameworks. Additionally, the library will support graph navigation and the maintenance of multiple paths simultaneously.

## Introduction

Maintaining and manipulating graphs is a common requirement in many applications, from data visualization to network analysis. This library will focus on providing a flexible and powerful interface for graph navigation and operations, designed to be used with React but not dependent on any specific UI components.

## Tech Stack

The library will be implemented using TypeScript and React 18.

## Proposed Interface

### Graph Creation

Create a graph without any nodes.

```ts
import { createGraph } from 'react-graph'

const graph = createGraph()
```

### Adding Nodes

```ts
addNode('node1', { label: 'Node 1' })
addNode('node2', { label: 'Node 2' })
```

### Adding Edges

```ts
addEdge('node1', 'node2')
```

### Adding Relative Nodes

```ts
node1.addNode('node2', { label: 'Node 2' })
// This creates a new node and connects it via an edge to the old node.
// Translates to:
addNode('node2', { label: 'Node 2' })
addEdge('node1', 'node2')

// Retrieve connecting nodes of a node
const nodes = node1.getConnectedNodes() // ['node2']
```

### Graph Navigation

```ts
// Returns a location object that contains the shortest path from node1 to node2.
node1.navigateTo('node2')
```

### Multiple Paths

```ts
navigate(['node1', 'node2', 'node3']) // Returns a location object that contains the shortest path from node1 over node2 to node3.
navigate(['node1', 'node4', 'node5'])
```

## Capabilities

- **Graph Creation**: Initialize and configure graphs.
- **Node and Edge Management**: Add, remove, and update nodes and edges.
- **Traversal and Search**: Implement common graph algorithms like DFS, BFS, and shortest path.
- **Graph Navigation**: Navigate through the graph and focus on specific nodes.
- **Multiple Paths**: Support maintaining multiple paths simultaneously.
- **Node Selection**: Allow users to select and highlight specific nodes in the graph for further interaction or analysis.

## Design Considerations

- **Headless Architecture**: The library will not include any UI components, allowing it to be used with any design or user interface depending on the use case â€“ e.g. in an accordion, tree, miller column etc.
- **Interface Augmentation**: The library will focus on the essential mechanics like graph creation and navigation. Any specific use cases can be build on top of this headless core. For example, the graph does not describe the relationships between nodes (e.g. 'parent-children', 'sibling') which are purely semantic. Instead the users can augment the library's interface and use the `meta` property of the node and edge interface to model any additional properties that are required for their use case.

## Implementation Plan

1. Initial setup and scaffolding
2. Basic graph operations (creation, addition, deletion)
3. Implementation of traversal algorithms
4. Graph navigation and multiple paths support
5. Node selection
6. Optimization and performance improvements
7. Documentation and examples
8. Feedback and Discussion

We welcome feedback from the community. Please open issues or pull requests in the public repository.
